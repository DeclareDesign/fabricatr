\title{Draw binary data with fixed intra-cluster correlation.}
\usage{
draw_binary_icc(x = 0.5, N = NULL, clusters, ICC = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A number or vector of numbers, one probability per cluster. If none
is provided, will default to 0.5.}

\item{N}{(Optional) A number indicating the number of observations to be
generated. Must be equal to length(clusters) if provided.}

\item{clusters}{A vector of factors or items that can be coerced to
clusters; the length will determine the length of the generated data.}

\item{ICC}{A number indicating the desired ICC, if none is provided will
default to 0.}
}
\value{
A vector of binary numbers corresponding to the observations from
the supplied cluster IDs.
}
\description{
Data is generated to ensure inter-cluster correlation 0, intra-cluster
correlation in expectation ICC. Algorithm taken from Hossein,
Akhtar. "ICCbin: An R Package Facilitating Clustered Binary Data
Generation, and Estimation of Intracluster Correlation Coefficient (ICC)
for Binary Data".

\examples{
clusters = rep(1:5, 10)
draw_binary_icc(clusters = clusters)

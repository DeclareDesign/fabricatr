\title{Draw normal data with fixed intra-cluster correlation.}
\usage{
draw_normal_icc(x = 0, N = NULL, cluster_ids, sd = 1, rho = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A number or vector of numbers, one mean per cluster.}

\item{N}{(Optional) A number indicating the number of observations to be
generated. Must be equal to length(cluster_ids) if provided.}

\item{cluster_ids}{A vector of factors or items that can be coerced to
clusters; the length will determine the length of the generated data.}

\item{sd}{A number or vector of numbers, indicating the standard deviation of
each cluster's error terms}

\item{rho}{A number indicating the desired RCC.}
}
\value{
A vector of numbers corresponding to the observations from
the supplied cluster IDs.
}
\description{
Data is generated to ensure inter-cluster correlation 0, intra-cluster
correlation in expectation \eqn{\rho}{rho}. The data generating process
used in this function is specified at the following URL:

\examples{
cluster_ids = rep(1:5, 10)
draw_normal_icc(cluster_ids = cluster_ids)

\title{Draw discrete variables including binary, binomial count, poisson count,
ordered, and categorical}
\usage{
draw_binomial(prob, trials = 1, N = length(prob), link = "identity")

draw_categorical(prob, N = NULL, link = "identity",
  category_labels = NULL)

draw_ordered(x, breaks = c(-1, 0, 1), break_labels = NULL, N = length(x),
  link = "identity")

draw_count(mean, N = length(mean), link = "identity")

draw_binary(prob, N = length(prob), link = "identity")

draw_likert(x, type = 7, breaks = NULL, N = length(x),
  link = "identity")
}
\arguments{
\item{prob}{A number or vector of numbers representing the probability for
binary or binomial outcomes; or a number, vector, or matrix of numbers
representing probabilities for categorical outcomes. If you supply a link
function, these underlying probabilities will be transformed.}

\item{trials}{for `draw_binomial`, the number of trials for each observation}

\item{N}{number of units to draw. Defaults to the length of the vector of
probabilities or latent data you provided.}

\item{link}{link function between the latent variable and the probability of
a postiive outcome, e.g. "logit", "probit", or "identity". For the "identity"
link, the latent variable must be a probability.}

\item{category_labels}{vector of labels for the categories produced by
`draw_categorical`. If provided, must be equal to the number of categories
provided in the `prob` argument.}

\item{x}{for `draw_ordered` or `draw_likert`, the latent data for each
observation.}

\item{breaks}{vector of breaks to cut a latent outcome into ordered
categories with `draw_ordered` or `draw_likert`}

\item{break_labels}{vector of labels for the breaks to cut a latent outcome
into ordered categories with `draw_ordered`. (Optional)}

\item{mean}{for `draw_count`, the mean number of count units for each observation}

\item{type}{Type of Likert scale data for `draw_likert`. Valid options are 4,
5, and 7. Type corresponds to the number of categories in the Likert scale.}
}
\value{
A vector of data in accordance with the specification; generally
numeric but for some functions, including `draw_ordered`, may be factor if
break labels are provided.
}
\description{
Drawing discrete data based on probabilities or latent traits is a common
task that can be cumbersome. Each function in our discrete drawing set creates
a different type of discrete data: \code{draw_binary} creates binary 0/1 data,
\code{draw_binomial} creates binomial data (repeated trial binary data),
\code{draw_categorical} creates categorical data, \code{draw_ordered}
transforms latent data into observed ordered categories, \code{draw_count}
creates count data (poisson-distributed). \code{draw_likert} is an alias to
\code{draw_ordered} that pre-specifies break labels and offers default breaks
appropriate for a likert survey question.

# Repeated trials: `draw_binomial`

   ordered = draw_ordered(x = x,
                          breaks = c(-Inf, -1, 1, Inf)))

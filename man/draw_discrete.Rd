\arguments{
\item{prob}{A number or vector of numbers representing the probability for
binary or binomial outcomes; or a number, vector, or matrix of numbers
representing probabilities for categorical outcomes. If you supply a link
function, these underlying probabilities will be transformed.}

\item{trials}{for \code{draw_binomial}, the number of trials for each observation}

\item{N}{number of units to draw. Defaults to the length of the vector of
probabilities or latent data you provided.}

\item{latent}{If the user provides a link argument other than identity, they
should provide the variable \code{latent} rather than \code{prob} or \code{mean}}

\item{link}{link function between the latent variable and the probability of
a positive outcome, e.g. "logit", "probit", or "identity". For the "identity"
link, the latent variable must be a probability.}

\item{quantile_y}{A vector of quantiles; if provided, rather than drawing
stochastically from the distribution of interest, data will be drawn at
exactly those quantiles.}

\item{category_labels}{vector of labels for the categories produced by
\code{draw_categorical}. If provided, must be equal to the number of categories
provided in the \code{prob} argument.}

\item{x}{for \code{draw_ordered}, the latent data for each
observation.}

\item{breaks}{vector of breaks to cut a latent outcome into ordered
categories with \code{draw_ordered}}

\item{break_labels}{vector of labels for the breaks to cut a latent outcome
into ordered categories with \code{draw_ordered}. (Optional)}

\item{strict}{Logical indicating whether values outside the provided breaks should be coded as NA. Defaults to \code{FALSE}, in which case effectively additional breaks are added between -Inf and the lowest break and between the highest break and Inf.}

\item{mean}{for \code{draw_count}, the mean number of count units for each observation}

\item{type}{The number of buckets to split data into. For a median split,
enter 2; for terciles, enter 3; for quartiles, enter 4; for quintiles, 5;
for deciles, 10.}
}
\value{
A vector of data in accordance with the specification; generally
numeric but for some functions, including \code{draw_ordered} and
\code{draw_categorical}, may be factor if labels are provided.
}
\description{
Drawing discrete data based on probabilities or latent traits is a common
task that can be cumbersome. Each function in our discrete drawing set creates
a different type of discrete data: \code{draw_binary} creates binary 0/1 data,
\code{draw_binomial} creates binomial data (repeated trial binary data),
\code{draw_categorical} creates categorical data, \code{draw_ordered}
transforms latent data into observed ordered categories, \code{draw_count}
creates count data (poisson-distributed).

# Drawing binary values (success or failure, treatment assignment)

# into a probability range).

# Repeated trials: `draw_binomial`
fabricate(N = 3,
   p = c(0, .5, 1),
   binomial = draw_binomial(prob = p, trials = 10))

# Ordered data: transforming latent data into observed, ordinal data.
# useful for survey responses.

   x = 5 * rnorm(N),
   ordered = draw_ordered(x = x,
                          breaks = c(-Inf, -1, 1, Inf)))

# Providing break labels for latent data.

# Categorical data: useful for demographic data.

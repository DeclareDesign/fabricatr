#' Creates panel or cross-classified data
#'
#' This function allows the user to create data structures that are paneled or
#' cross-classified: where one level of observation draws simultaneously from
#' two or many source levels. Common examples of panels include country-year
#' data which have country-level and year-level characteristics.
#'
#' By specifying the appropriate arguments in \code{join_using()} within the
#' function call, it is possible to induce correlation in cross-classified data.
#'
#' @param N The number of observations in the resulting data frame.
#' If \code{N} is NULL or not provided, the join will be an "outer product" --
#' merging each row of each provided data frame with each other data frame to
#' make a full panel.
#' @param by The result of a call to \code{join_using()} which specifies how
#' the cross-classified data will be created
#' @param ... A variable or series of variables to add to the resulting data
#' frame after the cross-classified data is created.
#'
#' @return data.frame

#' Helper function handling specification of which variables to join a

#' Correlation structures can only be provided if the underlying call is

#'
#' @param ... A series of two or more variable names, unquoted, to join on in
#' order to create cross-classified data.
#' @param rho A fixed (Spearman's rank) correlation coefficient between the
